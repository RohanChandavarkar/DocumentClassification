If a person is physically fit, he is also mentally fit and healthy.  There is always a sound mind in a sound body.  A healthy man is always hopeful and cheerful.  On the other hand, an unhealthy person leads a painful and miserable life.  Life become a burden to him. Games and sports also produce a sense of equality, co-operation and fraternity.  Games provide enough of amusement to remove the rust caused by our dull routine.  Games add colour to an otherwise dull and boring life.   All those qualities which we get from the playground help us to face the struggle of life.
War is dangerous.
